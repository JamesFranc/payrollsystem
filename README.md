Payroll System - Software Engineering Team Project
===================================================

323 Term Project
Some simple things have been done so far. I will handle prettying up the forms that exist and get them to function as expected.

Current Functionality:
- Employee Clock In/Out (simulated)
- Administrative Login
- Administrative Functions:
                          - Employee Management
                          - Time Card Management
                          - Print Cheques (simulated, should print out to file, encrypt file and send to bank)
                          - Print W2s (simulated, should print out to file)

Needed Functionality:
                        - Clock In/Out: Need to adjust flags and record times in employee objects
                        - Pay Caluclation: can be done once the above is implemented (OT, Regular Pay, etc)

For the above forms follow our Moqups example here: https://moqups.com/francis.jamesii@gmail.com/SltHdfrV/p:a1cf77150

If anyone has any problems using this git please let me know. - Jimmy
